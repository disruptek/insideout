## Telegram example of Flow-Based Programming
##
## https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming

##     In computer programming, flow-based programming (FBP) is a
##     programming paradigm that defines applications as networks of black
##     box processes, which exchange data across predefined connections
##     by message passing, where the connections are specified externally
##     to the processes. These black box processes can be reconnected
##     endlessly to form different applications without having to be
##     changed internally. FBP is thus naturally component-oriented.

##     FBP is a particular form of dataflow programming based on bounded
##     buffers, information packets with defined lifetimes, named ports,
##     and separate definition of connections.

##

##     FBP components often form complementary pairs. This example
##     uses two such pairs. The problem described seems very simple as
##     described in words, but in fact is surprisingly difficult to
##     accomplish using conventional procedural logic. The task, called
##     the "Telegram Problem", originally described by Peter Naur, is to
##     write a program which accepts lines of text and generates output
##     lines containing as many words as possible, where the number of
##     characters in each line does not exceed a certain length. The words
##     may not be split and we assume no word is longer than the size of
##     the output lines. This is analogous to the word-wrapping problem in
##     text editors.

## this example exhibits the following features:
## - backpressure controls flow of data
## - lock-free mailboxes move data
## - components run in their own threads
## - component communication is asynchronous
