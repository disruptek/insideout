We think it's easier to move continuations from thread to thread than it is
to move arbitrary data. We offer API that lets you imperatively move your
continuation to other thread pools without any locking or copies.

This experiment has expanded to support detached threads, channels with
backpressure, lock-free queues, and a "local" event queue for I/O and signal
handling.

## Goals

- extremely high efficiency, *but*
- favor generality over performance
- zero-copy migration among threads
- lock-free without busy loops
- detached threads for robustness
- idiomatic; minimal boilerplate
- standard `Continuation` passing
- arbitrary `ref` and `ptr` passing
- expose thread affinity, attributes
- event queue included for I/O
- enable incremental CPS adoption
- be the concurrency-lib's toolkit

## Performance

Adequate.

Inside a single thread, concurrency is cooperative and lock-free, so if you
don't yield to the dispatcher, your continuation may only be interrupted by a
signal from another thread. At present, the only occasions for interruption are
when you call `halt()` on a thread, or use the pause/resume functions named
`freeze()` and `thaw()`.

## Efficiency

Empty continuations are 40-bytes each.  Queue overhead is 10-bytes per object.
One billion queued continuations thus occupies 50gb of memory.

Toys are starting to run a little more slowly due to overhead from things like
thread cancellation, signal handling and, more generally, the event queue.

That said, the tests demonstrate using the (richest) API to run millions of
continuations per second on modern desktop hardware.

## Support

insideout supports `define:useMalloc`, `mm:arc`, `backend:c`,
and POSIX threads. insideout does not support `mm:orc`.

insideout is primarily developed using
[Nimskull](https://github.com/nim-works/nimskull)
and may not work with mainline Nim.

insideout is tested with compiler sanitizers to make sure it doesn't
demonstrate memory leaks or data-races.

## Documentation

Nim's documentation generator breaks when attempting to read insideout.

Define `insideoutValgrind=on` to enable Valgrind-specific annotations.
