# insideout

This is an experimental concurrency runtime for Nim.

The basic conceit is that it's easier to move continuations
from thread to thread than it is to move arbitrary data.

## Goals

- extremely high efficiency, *but*
- favor generality over performance
- zero-copy migration among threads
- lock-free without busy loops
- detached threads for robustness
- idiomatic; minimal boilerplate
- standard `Continuation` passing
- arbitrary `ref` and `ptr` passing
- expose thread affinity, attributes
- event queue included for I/O
- enable incremental CPS adoption
- be the concurrency-lib's toolkit

## Performance

Adequate.

## Efficiency

Empty continuations are 40-bytes each.  Queue overhead is 10-bytes per object.
One billion queued continuations thus occupies 50gb of memory.  Executing
1,000,000,000 unique continuations on my 32-thread machine takes ~3 seconds.

## Support

insideout supports `define:useMalloc`, `mm:arc`, `backend:c`,
and POSIX threads. insideout does not support `mm:orc`.

insideout is primarily developed using
[Nimskull](https://github.com/nim-works/nimskull)
and may not work with mainline Nim.

insideout is tested with compiler sanitizers to make sure it doesn't
demonstrate memory leaks or data-races.

## Documentation

Nim's documentation generator breaks when attempting to read insideout.

Define `insideoutValgrind=on` to enable Valgrind-specific annotations.
